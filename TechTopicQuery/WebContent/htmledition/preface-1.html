Preface</A>
</H1>

<P>
As recently as the 1990s, studies showed that most people preferred getting
information from other people rather than from information retrieval systems.
Of course, in that time period, most people also used human
travel agents to book their travel.
However, during the last decade, relentless
optimization of
information retrieval effectiveness
has driven web search
engines to new quality levels where most people are satisfied most of
the time, and web search has become a standard and often preferred
source of information finding.
For example, the 2004 Pew Internet Survey (<A
 HREF="bibliography-1.html#fallows04internet">Fallows, 2004</A>) found that ``92% of Internet users say
the Internet is a good place to go for getting everyday information.''
To the surprise of many, the field of information retrieval has moved from being a primarily academic discipline to being the basis underlying most people's preferred means of information access.
This book presents the scientific underpinnings of this
field, at a level accessible to graduate students as well as
advanced undergraduates.

<P>
Information retrieval did not begin with the Web.  In
response to various challenges of providing information
access, the field of information retrieval evolved to give
principled approaches to searching various forms of content.  The field began with scientific publications and library records, but soon spread to other forms of content, particularly those of information professionals, such as journalists, lawyers, and doctors.  Much of the scientific research on  information retrieval has occurred in these contexts, and much of the continued practice of information retrieval deals with providing access to unstructured information in various corporate and governmental domains, and this work forms much of the foundation of our book.

<P>
Nevertheless, in recent years, a principal driver of
innovation has been the World Wide Web, unleashing
publication at the scale of tens of millions of content
creators.  This explosion of published information would be
moot if the information could not be found, annotated and
analyzed so that each user can quickly find information that
is both relevant and comprehensive for their needs.  By the
late 1990s, many people felt that continuing to index the
whole Web would rapidly become impossible, due to the Web's
exponential growth in size.  But major scientific
innovations, superb engineering, the rapidly declining price
of computer hardware, and the rise of a commercial
underpinning for web search have all conspired to
power today's major search engines, which are able to
provide high-quality results within subsecond response times
for hundreds of millions of searches a day over billions of
web pages.
