<H1><A NAME="SECTION00510000000000000000">
Book organization and course development</A>
</H1>

<P>
This book is the result of a series of courses we have
taught at Stanford University and at the University of
Stuttgart, in a range of durations including a single
quarter, one semester and two quarters.  These courses were
aimed at early-stage graduate students in computer science,
but we have also had enrollment from upper-class computer
science undergraduates, as well as students from law,
medical informatics, statistics, linguistics and various
engineering disciplines.  The key design principle for this
book, therefore, was to cover what we believe to be
important in a one-term graduate course on information
retrieval.  An additional principle is to build each chapter
around material that we believe can be covered in a single
lecture of 75 to 90 minutes.

<P>
The first eight chapters of the book are devoted to the
basics of information retrieval, and in particular the heart
of search engines; we consider this material to be core to
any course on information retrieval.  Chapter <A HREF="boolean-retrieval-1.html#ch:intro">1</A> 
introduces inverted indexes, and shows how simple Boolean
queries can be processed using such indexes.
Chapter <A HREF="the-term-vocabulary-and-postings-lists-1.html#ch:dictionary">2</A>  builds on this introduction by
detailing the manner in which documents are preprocessed
before indexing and by discussing how inverted indexes are
augmented in various ways for functionality and
speed. Chapter <A HREF="dictionaries-and-tolerant-retrieval-1.html#ch:spell">3</A>  discusses search structures for
dictionaries and how to process queries that have spelling
errors and other imprecise matches to the vocabulary in the
document collection being searched.
Chapter <A HREF="index-construction-1.html#ch:iconst">4</A>  describes a number of algorithms for
constructing the inverted index from a text collection with
particular attention to highly scalable and distributed
algorithms that can be applied to very large collections.
Chapter <A HREF="index-compression-1.html#ch:icompress">5</A>  covers techniques for compressing
dictionaries and inverted indexes.
These techniques are critical
for achieving subsecond response times to user queries in
large search engines.
The indexes and queries considered in
introicompress only deal with <I>Boolean
retrieval</I>, in which a document either matches a query, or does
not. A desire to measure the <I>extent</I> to which a document
matches a query, or the score of a document for a query, motivates the development of term weighting and the
computation of scores in Chapters <A HREF="scoring-term-weighting-and-the-vector-space-model-1.html#ch:tfidf">6</A> <A HREF="computing-scores-in-a-complete-search-system-1.html#ch:cosine">7</A> , leading
to the idea of a list of documents that are rank-ordered for
a query.  Chapter <A HREF="evaluation-in-information-retrieval-1.html#ch:evaluation">8</A>  focuses on the evaluation of
an information retrieval system based on the relevance of
the documents it retrieves, allowing us to compare the
relative performances of different systems on benchmark
document collections and queries.

<P>
queryexpansionlink
build on the foundation of the first eight chapters to cover
a variety of more advanced topics.
  Chapter <A HREF="relevance-feedback-and-query-expansion-1.html#ch:queryexpansion">9</A> 
discusses methods by which retrieval can be enhanced through
the use of techniques like relevance feedback and query
expansion, which aim at increasing the likelihood of
retrieving relevant documents. Chapter <A HREF="xml-retrieval-1.html#ch:xml">10</A>  considers
information retrieval from documents that are structured
with markup languages like XML and HTML. We treat structured
retrieval by
reducing it to the vector space scoring methods developed in
Chapter <A HREF="scoring-term-weighting-and-the-vector-space-model-1.html#ch:tfidf">6</A> .  Chapters <A HREF="probabilistic-information-retrieval-1.html#ch:probir">11</A> <A HREF="language-models-for-information-retrieval-1.html#ch:lmodels">12</A>  invoke
probability theory to compute scores for documents on
queries.  Chapter <A HREF="probabilistic-information-retrieval-1.html#ch:probir">11</A>  develops traditional
probabilistic information retrieval, which provides a
framework for computing the probability of relevance of a
document, given a set of query terms. This probability may
then be used as a score in ranking.  Chapter <A HREF="language-models-for-information-retrieval-1.html#ch:lmodels">12</A> 
illustrates an alternative, wherein for each document in a
collection, we build a language model from which one can
estimate a probability that the language model generates a
given query.

<P>
This probability is another quantity with which we can rank-order
documents.

<P>
nbayeshierclust
give a treatment of various forms of machine learning and
numerical methods in
information retrieval.  nbayessvm treat the
problem of classifying documents into a set of known
categories, given a set of documents along with the classes
they belong to.
Chapter <A HREF="text-classification-and-naive-bayes-1.html#ch:nbayes">13</A>  motivates statistical classification as one
of the key technologies needed for a successful search
engine, introduces Naive Bayes, a conceptually simple and
efficient text classification method, and outlines the
standard methodology for evaluating text classifiers.
Chapter <A HREF="vector-space-classification-1.html#ch:vcat">14</A>  employs
the vector space model from Chapter <A HREF="scoring-term-weighting-and-the-vector-space-model-1.html#ch:tfidf">6</A>  and introduces
two classification methods, Rocchio and kNN, that operate on document vectors.
It also presents the bias-variance tradeoff as an important
characterization of learning problems that provides criteria
for
selecting
an appropriate method for a text classification problem.
Chapter <A HREF="support-vector-machines-and-machine-learning-on-documents-1.html#ch:svm">15</A>  introduces support vector machines, which many
researchers currently view as the most effective text
classification method.
We also develop connections
in this chapter between the problem of classification and seemingly disparate
topics such as the induction of scoring functions from a set
of training examples.

<P>
flatclust
lsi
consider the problem of
inducing clusters of related documents from a collection.
In Chapter <A HREF="flat-clustering-1.html#ch:flatclust">16</A> , we first give an overview of a number of
important applications of clustering in information
retrieval. We then describe two flat clustering algorithms: the  <IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img30.png"
 ALT="$K$">-means
algorithm, an efficient and widely used document clustering
method; and the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which is computationally
more expensive, but
also more flexible.
Chapter <A HREF="hierarchical-clustering-1.html#ch:hierclust">17</A> 
motivates the need for hierarchically structured clusterings
(instead of flat clusterings) in many applications in
information retrieval and
introduces a number of clustering
algorithms that produce a hierarchy of clusters. The chapter
also addresses the difficult problem of automatically
computing labels for clusters.
  Chapter <A HREF="matrix-decompositions-and-latent-semantic-indexing-1.html#ch:lsi">18</A>  develops
methods from linear algebra that constitute an extension of
clustering, and also offer intriguing prospects for
algebraic methods in information retrieval, which have been
pursued in the approach of latent semantic indexing.

<P>
webcharlink treat the problem of web search.  We give in Chapter <A HREF="web-search-basics-1.html#ch:webchar">19</A>  a summary of the basic challenges in web search, together with a set of techniques that are pervasive in web information retrieval.  Next, Chapter <A HREF="web-crawling-and-indexes-1.html#ch:crawling">20</A>  describes the architecture and requirements of a basic web crawler.  Finally, Chapter <A HREF="link-analysis-1.html#ch:link">21</A>  considers the power of link analysis in web search, using in the process several methods from linear algebra and advanced probability theory.

<P>
This book is not comprehensive in covering all topics
related to information retrieval.  We have put aside a
number of topics, which we deemed outside the scope of what
we wished to cover in an introduction to information
retrieval class.  Nevertheless, for people interested in
these topics, we provide a few pointers to mainly textbook
coverage here.
